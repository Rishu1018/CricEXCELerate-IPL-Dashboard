Task carried out

# 1. Getting dataset from the client (although this dataset was gotten here in Kaggle)
Data was taken from Kaggle Data is available in the google drive link below: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickb1912/ipl-complete-dataset-20082020?select=IPL+Matches+2008-2020.csv

# 2. Understanding the Business Case
KPIs were studied with respect to the dataset, also stakeholders holders were determined

# 3. Data Cleaning
Duplication was removed, columns and rows adjusted, spelling checks were done, and a few other things

# 4. Data Processing
This is more like extracting more details from the cleaned data to help with data analysis, for example, monthly and year column was added to help with analysis as the client requested for the seasonal trend in comparison to current and previous years

# 5. Data Analysis (using pivot tables and of course excel formulas)
Pivot tables and pivot charts were created across different sheets with respect to achieving the KPIs. Thereafter, a Data Analysis Sheet was created housing all the pivot tables earlier created for data analysis.

# 6. Data Visualisation (using charts to show insights)
Data visualization was done using pivot charts,

# 7. Creation of a dynamic and interactive dashboard
The dashboard became interactive and dynamic by creating a filter panel using a timeline and slicer as already created in the pivot table
