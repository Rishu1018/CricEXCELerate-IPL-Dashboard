## Project Overview:
The project involves the creation of a dynamic Excel dashboard for analyzing IPL (Indian Premier League) data spanning from 2008 to 2018. The dashboard utilizes Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts to provide an in-depth analysis of over 800 data points. It offers insights into match outcomes, venue statistics, player performance, and team data. The data is cleaned and transformed for accuracy, leading to a significant reduction in data-related errors.

## Business Case:
The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a highly popular cricket tournament that generates a vast amount of data. Analyzing this data can provide valuable insights for team strategies, player performance evaluation, and understanding fan engagement. However, handling such large and complex datasets can be challenging. The dynamic Excel dashboard aims to streamline data analysis, making it easier for stakeholders, analysts, and team management to make informed decisions based on historical IPL data.

## Project Goal:
The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive Excel dashboard that enables users to gain insights from IPL data spanning a decade (2008-2018). The dashboard should provide visualizations and summaries of match outcomes, venue trends, player performance, and team statistics. By doing so, the project aims to facilitate data-driven decision-making processes for IPL teams, analysts, and cricket enthusiasts.

# Task carried out

# 1. Getting dataset from the client (although this dataset was gotten here in Kaggle)
Data was taken from Kaggle Data which is available in the given link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickb1912/ipl-complete-dataset-20082020?select=IPL+Matches+2008-2020.csv.

# 2. Understanding the Business Case
KPIs were studied with respect to the dataset, also stakeholder holders were determined.

# 3. Data Cleaning
Duplication was removed, columns and rows adjusted, spelling checks were done, and a few other things.

# 4. Data Processing
This is more like extracting more details from the cleaned data to help with data analysis, for example, monthly and year column was added to help with analysis as the client requested for the seasonal trend in comparison to current and previous years.

# 5. Data Analysis (using pivot tables and of course Excel formulas)
Pivot tables and pivot charts were created across different sheets with respect to achieving the KPIs. Thereafter, a Data Analysis Sheet was created housing all the pivot tables earlier created for data analysis.
